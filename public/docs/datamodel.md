# HH Trucks — Data Model (Source of Truth)

## 1. Core Concept

The system is a structured version of existing Excel operations.

Two data sources:

1. Trip Ledger → revenue + trip-level expenses
2. Maintenance Ledger → monthly truck-level costs

All analytics are derived from combining these two.

---

## 2. Trip Data Structure

Each row represents one completed trip.

### Fields

- truckNumber (Vehicle No.)
- loadDate
- dischargeDate
- grossAmount (FINAL revenue from Excel)

### Expense Fields (all part of trip cost)

- diesel
- advance
- toll
- loadUnload
- rtoExpenses
- police
- otherExpenses
- driverBalance (optional)

### Derived Fields

- totalExpenses = sum(all expense fields)
- tripProfit = grossAmount - totalExpenses

---

## 3. Maintenance Data Structure

Maintenance is tracked monthly per truck (from Excel).

### Fields

- truckNumber
- month (YYYY-MM)
- totalCost

### Includes

- driver salary
- insurance
- permits
- repair & servicing
- tyres
- other operational overhead

NOTE:
Maintenance already includes idle cost and fixed ownership cost.
No separate idle cost calculation is required.

---

## 4. Business Logic

### Trip Level

tripProfit = grossAmount - totalExpenses

---

### Truck Level (Monthly)

truckProfit =
sum(tripProfit for that truck in given month)
− maintenanceCost (for that truck and month)

---

## 5. Time Handling

- All analytics are month-based
- Trips are assigned to a month using dischargeDate (close date)

---

## 6. System Rules

- Trips follow lifecycle: PLANNED → ACTIVE → CLOSED
- Only CLOSED trips are used for reporting
- CLOSED trips are immutable

### Close Conditions

- expenses must exist
- outstanding must be 0 (client fully paid)

### Allowed

- loss-making trips (tripProfit < 0)

---

## 7. Data Assumptions (IMPORTANT)

- Gross Amount is final revenue (do not recompute using qty × rate)
- All expense columns in Excel are part of trip cost
- No separate broker cost (already included in expense columns)
- No need to calculate idle days or daily cost
- Maintenance file is the source of truth for truck-level costs

---

## 8. Final Objective

The system must answer:

- Which trips are profitable?
- Which trucks are profitable monthly?
- Which trucks are causing losses?

Primary focus:
Truck-level profitability
